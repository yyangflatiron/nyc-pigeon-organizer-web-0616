## NYC Pigeon Organizer

## Objectives

1. Understand Hashes and Nesting
2. Work on Sorting Hashes and manipulating nested data structures.

## Instructions

You are given the following collected data on New York City pigeons in the form of a hash.

```ruby
pigeon_data = {
  :color => {
    :purple => ["Theo", "Peter Jr.", "Lucky"],
    :grey => ["Theo", "Peter Jr.", "Ms. K"],
    :white => ["Queenie", "Andrew", "Ms. K", "Alex"],
    :brown => ["Queenie", "Alex"]
  },
  :gender => {
    :male => ["Alex", "Theo", "Peter Jr.", "Andrew", "Lucky"],
    :female => ["Queenie", "Ms. K"]
  },
  :lives => {
    "Subway" => ["Theo", "Queenie"],
    "Central Park" => ["Alex", "Ms. K", "Lucky"],
    "Library" => ["Peter Jr."],
    "City Hall" => ["Andrew"]
  }
}
```

Iterate over the hash above, collecting each pigeon by name and insert it
as the key of a new hash where each name holds the attributes for that bird. 
Your output should look something like the hash below:

```ruby
pigeon_list = {
  "Theo" => {
    :color => ["purple", "grey"],
    :gender => ["male"],
    :lives => ["Subway"]
  },
  "Peter Jr." => {
    :color => ["purple", "grey"],
    :gender => ["male"],
    :lives => ["Library"]
  },
  "Lucky" => {
    :color => ["purple"],
    :gender => ["male"],
    :lives => ["Central Park"]
  },
  "Ms. K" => {
    :color => ["grey", "white"],
    :gender => ["female"],
    :lives => ["Central Park"]
  },
  "Queenie" => {
    :color => ["white", "brown"],
    :gender => ["female"],
    :lives => ["Subway"]
  },
  "Andrew" => {
    :color => ["white"],
    :gender => ["male"],
    :lives => ["City Hall"]
  },
  "Alex" => {
    :color => ["white", "brown"],
    :gender => ["male"],
    :lives => ["Central Park"]
  }
}
```
